Dear Ying-Chun Liu (PaulLiu): 
He implemented the WORLD for GNU/Linux.
WORLD 0.0.4_1 and later are based on his program.

Dear Takuya Ooura: 
We used his source code on FFT (Version 0.1.0).
This program made it possible to avoid using FFTW,
and we can release WORLD under modified BSD license.
