World
===

World: High-quality speech analysis, modification and synthesis system developed by M. Morise.

Although World has a matlab version which is compatible with GNU Octave, it runs much slower than the C++ version in Octave. Here I ported the C++ version to Octave which achieves roughly 10x better performance.

How to compile (on Linux)
---

```bash
make
cd octave-port
make
```
